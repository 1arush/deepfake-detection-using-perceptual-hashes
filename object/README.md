# deepfake detection in object images

This contains images, plots and relevant code for deepfake detection in general images (objects).

- chunk_objects.py : Code to chunk objects into various partitions, then compute hashes using Imagehash and write to csv.
- chunk_objects.scala : Code to the same as above, but using Scala hash programs.
- chunk_plots.ipynb : Code used to perform the visualization for each image, as well as for the averages.
