# deepfake-detection-using-perceptual-hashes

This repository contains code and data for various investigations on detecting deepfakes using perceptual hashes.

There are 2 perceptual hashing programs in consideration:
- Python implementation (https://pypi.org/project/ImageHash/)
- Scala implementation (https://gist.github.com/Howon/7db1239355841a71ffa9)
