File 'noise_plots.ipynb' contains all the code used to generate the plots for noise sensitivity.

The images follow a naming convention. There are 2 types of images:
- `<image><number>_<noise_type>`
- `<image>_avg_<noise_type>`

`<noise_type>` = u (uniform) and g (gaussian)

`<number>` = a number ranging from 1 to 4 (correspond to image names from the images folder)
