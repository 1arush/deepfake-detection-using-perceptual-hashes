File 'noise_plots.ipynb' contains all the code used to generate the plots for noise sensitivity. All the plots have
been made using the csv files in the 'csv' directory.

The images follow a naming convention in accordance with those from the images folder. There are 2 types of images:
- `<image><number>_<noise_type>`
- `_<image>_avg_<noise_type>`

`<image>` : the type of image; m = male face, f = female face, o = object

`<noise_type>` : u (uniform) and g (gaussian)

`<number>` : a number ranging from 1 to 4 (correspond to image names from the images folder)
